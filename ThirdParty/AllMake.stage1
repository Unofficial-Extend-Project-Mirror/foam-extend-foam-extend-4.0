# Script
#     AllMake.stage1
#
# Description
#     Build script for ThirdParty packages: Stage1
#
#     Compilers and basic tools.
#
#     Once this stage is built, you would normally re-initialize your
#     OpenFOAM environment in order to use the new compilers and tools
#
#     NOTE: This stage is optional. Use it only if you want to override 
#           your system pre-installed compilers and tools
#
# Requirements:
#     1: Your OpenFOAM environment must be properly initialized
#
# Author:
#     Martin Beaudoin, Hydro-Quebec, (2010)
