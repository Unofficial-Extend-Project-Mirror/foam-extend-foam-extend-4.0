# Script
#     AllMake.stage5
#
# Description
#     Build script for ThirdParty packages not requiring rpm packaging
#
#
# Requirements:
#     1: Your foam-extend environment must be properly initialized
#     2: foam-extend must already been compiled because swak4Foam depends on
#        foam-extend include files and libraries
#
# Author:
#     Martin Beaudoin, Hydro-Quebec, (2012)

# run from Third-party directory only
