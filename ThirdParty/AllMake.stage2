# Script
#     AllMake.stage2
#
# Description
#     Build script for ThirdParty packages: Stage2
#
#     Communication libraries
#
#     Once this stage is built, you would normally re-initialize your
#     OpenFOAM environment in order redirect OpenFOAM toward the appropriate
#     communication library 
#
#     NOTE: This stage is optional. Use it only if you want to override 
#           your system communication libraries
#
# Requirements:
#     1: Your OpenFOAM environment must be properly initialized
#     2: AllMake.stage1 if you are overriding your system compiler
#
