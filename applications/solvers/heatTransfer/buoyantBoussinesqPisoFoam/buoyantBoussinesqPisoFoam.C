Application
    buoyantBoussinesqPisoFoam

Description
    Transient solver for buoyant, turbulent flow of incompressible fluids

    Uses the Boussinesq approximation:
    \f[
        rho_{k} = 1 - beta(T - T_{ref})
    \f]

    where:
        \f$ rho_{k} \f$ = the effective (driving) kinematic density
        beta = thermal expansion coefficient [1/K]
        T = temperature [K]
        \f$ T_{ref} \f$ = reference temperature [K]

    Valid when:
    \f[
        rho_{k} << 1
    \f]
