Application
    interIbFoam

Description
    Solver for 2 incompressible, isothermal immiscible fluids using a VOF
    (volume of fluid) phase-fraction based interface capturing approach,
    with immersed boundary support

    The momentum and other fluid properties are of the "mixture" and a single
    momentum equation is solved.

    Turbulence modelling is generic, i.e. laminar, RAS or LES may be selected.

    For a two-fluid approach see twoPhaseEulerFoam.
