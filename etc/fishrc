# Description
#     Startup file for OpenFOAM
#     Sourced from ~/..config/fish/config.fish
#     To be used from the fish-shell
#     Not really functional as no variables can be specified (somehow this breaks $argv)
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

set thisDir (python -c "from os.path import *;import sys;sys.stdout.write(dirname(abspath(join(curdir,'$thisScript'))))")
