#+TITLE: *XPP_SE viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 1.6-ext*

* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the 
  Extended Pom-Pom Single Equation constitutive model (XPP_SE).
  The geometry was the 4:1 plane contraction. See also the XPP_DE case.

*** This is only an illustrative case for the PP constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver. 

*** The parameters for the constitutive model was obtained from:
    VERBEETEN,W. M. H.; PETERS, G.W. M.; BAAIJENS, F. P. T. Differential constitutive
    equations for polymer melts: The extended pom-pom model. Journal of Rheology,
    SOR, v. 45, n. 4, p. 823-843, 2001.
