#+TITLE: *Feta-PTT viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 1.6-ext* 
#+AUTHOR: Jovani

* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the Fixed 
  Eta Phan-Thien-Tanner constitutive model (Feta-PTT).
  The geometry was a rectangular channel.  

*** This is only an illustrative case for this constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver.

*** The parameters for the constitutive model was obtained from:
    VERBEETEN, W. M. H. Computational polymer melt rheology. [S.l.]: CIP-Data Library
    Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, 2001.
