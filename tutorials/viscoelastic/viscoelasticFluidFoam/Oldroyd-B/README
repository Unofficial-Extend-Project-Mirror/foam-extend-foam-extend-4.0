#+TITLE: *Oldroyd-B viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 1.6-ext* 
#+AUTHOR: Jovani

* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the Oldroyd-B
  constitutive model (PTT-Linear).
  The geometry was the 4:1 plane contraction. This is a well studied 
  geometry in viscoelastic fluid flow research.

  More details about the model or parameters used can be found at:

*** L.M. Quinzani, R.C. Amstrong, R.A. Brown, Birefringence and laser-Doppler velocimetry (LDV) studies of
    viscoelastic flow through a planar contraction, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech. 52 (1994) 1-36.


*** This is only an illustrative case for the Oldroyd-B constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver.
