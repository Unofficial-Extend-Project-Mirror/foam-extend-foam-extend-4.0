#+TITLE: *Leonov viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 3.2*
#+AUTHOR: Jovani
#+DATE:  05 October 2010



* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the Leonov
  constitutive model (Leonov).
  The geometry was the 4:1 plane contraction.

*** This is only an illustrative case for the Leonov constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver.
