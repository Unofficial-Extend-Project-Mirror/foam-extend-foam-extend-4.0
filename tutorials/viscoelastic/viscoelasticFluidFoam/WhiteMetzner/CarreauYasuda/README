#+TITLE: *White-Metzner_Carreau-Yasuda viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 3.2*
#+AUTHOR: Jovani
#+DATE:  05 October 2010



* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the
  White-Metzner with Carreau-Yasuda viscosity constitutive model (White-Metzner_Carreau-Yasuda).
  The geometry was the 4:1 plane contraction.


*** This is only an illustrative case for the White-Metzner with Carreau-Yasuda constitutive model.
    Therefore, there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver.
