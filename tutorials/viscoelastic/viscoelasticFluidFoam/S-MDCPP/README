#+TITLE: *S-MDCPP viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 1.6-ext*

* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the 
  Simplified Modified Double Convected Pom-Pom constitutive model (S-MDCPP).
  The geometry was the 4:1 plane contraction. 

*** This is only an illustrative case for the S-MDCPP constitutive model. Therefore,
    there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver. New tests will be done for this model.

*** The parameters for the constitutive model was obtained from:
    Wei Wang; Xikui Li; Xianhong Han. A numerical study of constitutive models 
    endowed with Pom-Pom molecular attributes.Journal of Non-Newtonian 
    Fluid Mechanics, v. 165,p. 1480-1493, 2010.
