################################################################################

* Overview
  The foam-extend project is a fork of the OpenFOAM® open source library for 
  Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It is an open project welcoming and 
  integrating contributions from all users and developers. Previously known as 
  OpenFOAM®-dev and OpenFOAM®-extend, it contains bug fixes and performance 
  improvements, as well as extensions and additional features provided
  by community contributors (see file ListOfContributors), such as dynamic mesh 
  and topological change support, turbomachinery extensions including general
  grid interpolation (GGI), cyclic GGI and mixing plane, block-coupled matrix 
  support, finite area method, comprehensive mesh motion capability and GPU 
  support. For a full list, see below and previous release notes at:
  http://sourceforge.net/p/openfoam-extend/wiki/Home/

  Version 3.1, nicknamed "Zagreb", is the current version of foam-extend. The 
  release continues the tradition and spirit of the original FOAM code
  developed by prof. Jasak and Mr. Weller during their time at
  Imperial College and released as the general purpose CFD/CCM package by
  Nabla Ltd. in 2000. In this spirit, we reverted 18 December 2013 to the
  original numbering scheme (foam-2.3.2, 13 December 2004) as release
  number 3.0.

  foam-extend are a community effort not endorsed by ESI Group.

* Installation

* Compatibility
  Upstream features from the OpenFOAM® code base are merged into foam-extend
  on regular basis. The interface format of foam-extend-3.1 is largely
  compatible to OpenFOAM-1.6-ext and OpenFOAM-1.7.x. In some cases,
  the differences are caused by bug fixes and algorithmic improvements,
  considered more important than inter-operability.

* Main differentiators compared to OpenFOAM
  A large number of features have been lost within the release of OpenFOAM
  since version 1.3, the code base has shrunk by more than 40%.  While
  we understand the lack of technical ability of supporting advanced
  CFD features, we feel that existing features and specifically large-scale
  contributions should remain active and developed further. Below is a list
  of main features of foam-extend which are lacking, lost, deactivated or
  unusable in ESI releases:

  ** Turbomachinery features, including General Grid Interface (GGI),
     partial overlap GGI, cyclic GGI, with improvements in parallel scaling.
     First release of a mixing plane stage interface

  ** Dynamic mesh with topological changes
     Sliding interfaces, mesh layering, attach-detach boundaries etc.
     In foam-extend, full parallel support for topological changes
     is released for the first time

  ** Finite Element Method with support for polyhedral meshes
     This is mainly used in mesh deformation and over the last 15 years
     it has proven vastly superior to all other dynamic mesh methods.

  ** Advanced mesh deformation technology
     Including tet FEM mesh deformation, Radial Basis Function (RBF) mesh
     deformation, tetrahedral remeshing dynamic mesh support and solid body
     motion functions.  All of the above include parallelisation support

  ** Library of dynamic meshes with topological changes with full
     second order FVM discretisation support on moving meshes with
     topological changes

  ** Internal combustion engine-specific dynamic mesh classes such as
     two-stroke engine and various forms of 4-stroke and multi-valve
     dynamic mesh classes

  ** Finite Area Method providing support for FVM-like discretisation on
     a curved surface in 3-D, with examples of liquid film modelling

  ** Block-coupled matrix support, allowing fully implicit multi-equation
     solution of NxN equation sets, with full parallelisation support.
     First release of a block-AMG linear equation solver

  ** Fully implicit conjugate-coupled solution framework, allowing implicit
     solution fo multiple equations over multiple meshes, with parallelism

  ** Proper Orthogonal Decomposition data analysis tools, with applications
     to FOAM field classes

  ** Equation reader classes and tutorials

  ** Multi-solver solution framework, allowing multiple field models to be
     solved in a coupled manner

  ** A major contribution is solid mechanics modelling, including linear
     and non-linear materials, contact, self-contact and friction, with
     updated Lagrangian or absolute Lagrangian formulation.  Solution of
     damage models and crack propagation in complex materials via
     topological changes

  ** CUDA solver release, provided in full source and as an example of
     coupling external linear equation solvers with FOAM

  ** Library-level support for Immersed Boundary Method and Overset Mesh

  ** Major improvements in accuracy and stability of FVM discretisation
     with options on convection and diffusion discretisation, deferred
     correction or explicit schemes

  ** Algebraic multigrid solver framework

  ** 210 tutorials with automated run scripts

  ** Automatic test harness
