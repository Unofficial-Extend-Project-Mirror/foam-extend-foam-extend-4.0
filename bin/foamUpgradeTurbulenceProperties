# Description
#     Upgrade the turbulenceProperties dictionary to the new format employed
#     in OpenFOAM version 1.5-dev
#     - RAS turbulence models now defined by the RASProperties dictionary,
#       and RASModel keyword, and
#     - LES turbulence models now defined by the LESProperties dictionary,
#       and LESModel keyword.
