Description
    Central-difference snGrad scheme with limited non-orthogonal correction.
    The limiter is controlled by a coefficient with a value between 0 and 1
    which when zero switches the limiter off and the scheme behaves as
    correctedSnGrad, and when set to 1 the limiter is calculated such that the
    non-orthogonal contribution does not exceed the orthogonal part.
